# Deployment workflows

Docker Compose is the default local dependency stack. k3s with Tilt is an opt-in,
production-shaped development path. Neither path changes the package boundary: both install
the published `@teopeurt/flowkit-*` packages from npmjs.org, so image builds need no registry
credential.

## Compose

`docker-compose.yml` provides PostgreSQL, Temporal, the Temporal namespace helper, and Mailpit for
the one-command development workflow. `deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml` is the full containerized
application stack. Its images run a plain `bun install --frozen-lockfile`; no `npmrc` build secret
is required.

Validate configuration without starting services:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml config --quiet
```

Migration and seed services are deliberately ordered and guarded. Do not start them against any
database other than the disposable target, and do not set `FLOWKIT_DEMO_MIGRATION_APPROVED=true`
without explicit approval.

## k3s and Tilt

The default `Tiltfile` uses local Compose. Select k3s explicitly with:

```sh
export TILT_MODE=flowkit-k3s
export FLOWKIT_K3S_NAMESPACE=flowkit-demo-dev
export FLOWKIT_K3S_REGISTRY=registry.example.invalid/flowkit-demo-dev
tilt up
```

The implementation is `deploy/tilt/k3s.Tiltfile`; Kubernetes manifests are in `deploy/k8s`. Read
the operational prerequisites and secret bootstrap procedure in `deploy/README.md` and
`deploy/k8s/examples/README.md` before starting Tilt. Image builds install the published packages
from npmjs.org, so Tilt passes no registry secret. The migration and seed resources have manual
initialization, so trigger the migration only after explicit approval, then seed, then application
workloads.

The repository does not prescribe a cloud environment. Before changing manifests, run the static
deployment contract test:

```sh
bun test test/deployment-contract.test.ts
```
